[ The below explicit exemption, we hope, clears up the Tlabs
  developers' position concerning an ambiguity with the GNU General
  Public License concerning what constitutes a 'mere aggregation'
  versus a combined or derived work.  The intention is to make it
  clear that arbitrarily-licensed programs such as app.js modules do
  not automatically assume the GNU General Public License (GPL)
  themselves simply because of their invocation of (or by) procedures
  implemented in GPL-licensed code, via app.js or a similar interface
  to methods provided by the pdb: ]

* If you create a program which invokes (or provides) methods
  through the medium of app.js or another implementation of
  the 'procedural database' (pdb) serial protocol, then
  Tlabs developers' position is that this is a 'mere
  aggregation' of the program invoking the method and the program
  implementing the method as per section 2 of the GNU General Public
  License.
