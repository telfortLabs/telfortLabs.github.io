# telfortLabs - Portfolio

### In this project, I developed a portfolio website to present my work, skills, and background information.
###
### The website comprises four distinct sections:
###
### * The first section features my professional biography.
### * The second section highlights my diverse skill set.
### * The third section showcases a collection of my notable projects.
### * The fourth section includes a contact form that enables clients to reach out to me for further inquiries.
###
### The resources folder contains essential elements, including icons, CSS, and JavaScript files, that enhance the websiteâ€™s interactivity.
